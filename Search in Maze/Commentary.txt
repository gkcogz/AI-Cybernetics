- Very well done in function descriptions and the explanation of your code.
 It's an accepted practice to you """ """ for multi line; block comments for function descriptions instead of # for individual lines. 
- It is advisable to have the path reversal as a new method.
- Overall, it is a clean and very readable code. Well Done !
