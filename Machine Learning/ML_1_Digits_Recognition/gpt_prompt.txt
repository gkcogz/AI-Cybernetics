So, gpt, i want to first paste here the instructions of my assignment, we will write two classifiers: 1-NN nearest neighbor classifier, the naive bayes classifier.

We are allowed to use numpy and pillow.
We will create two different codes based on classifier.py which contains methods of argparse which we will use later on Python CLI. I have already got the data, let's start with instructions, if you need the data, let me know.
