Here, I upload my completed assigments at the Course BE5B33KUI: Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence of CVUT. 

1. Search in Maze Problem: Implementation of A*-Algorithm into kuimaze2 modules (by CVUT), libraries used: heapq, itertools.
2. Player Creation for Reversi Game: Implementation of the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
3. Search in Maze w. Markov Decision Process (MDP): The optimal path to the terminal state is determined by value- and policy-iteration.
